    <p>Hi there!  I'm Nicole.  I've been doing office and administrative work since 1998, and took a break in 2008 to pursue Massage Therapy. My administrative skills followed me into this industry working as an educator of massage.  I have spent much of my time in this field not only training students in massage, but developing and refining educational programs, creating documents for presentation and assisting with smaller but no less important tasks such as data entry and filing.  After being recruited to direct a massage program I was laid-off (through no fault of my own) and am now looking to return to work in office administration/management</p>
    <p>I pride myself in being quick to learn new things (such as web development - this website was written in HTML and CSS entirely by me!) and having a keen desire to do the work.  I have gained so many invaluable skills throughout the years and know I am able to translate these skills to any industry.  To name a few, I am an excellent written and oral communicator, a master of organization, and a strong leader.  I am always the person who will take on tasks first, no matter how big or small, and I will never sit idly by when there is work to be done.</p>
